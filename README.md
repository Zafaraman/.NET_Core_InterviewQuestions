what is the need of web api if we can achieve it by using MVC to return JSON data ?


That's a great question about web development architecture. To understand the distinction, let's compare Web APIs and MVC approaches:

Separation of concerns:
Web APIs are designed specifically for data exchange, typically following REST principles. They focus solely on providing data.
MVC can return JSON, but it's primarily designed for rendering views, with controllers handling both data and presentation logic.
Client flexibility:
Web APIs allow any client (web, mobile, IoT devices) to consume data independently.
MVC-returned JSON is often tailored to specific view requirements, potentially limiting reusability.
Scalability and performance:
Web APIs are typically more lightweight, as they don't carry view-related overhead.
MVC responses might include unnecessary data or processing for pure data exchange scenarios.
Versioning and evolution:
Web APIs can be easily versioned, allowing multiple clients to use different API versions simultaneously.
Evolving MVC-based JSON responses may be more challenging without affecting existing views.
Documentation and standards:
Web APIs often come with standardized documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) and follow established patterns.
MVC-returned JSON might lack formal documentation, making it harder for other developers or teams to consume.
While you can certainly use MVC to return JSON, dedicated Web APIs offer advantages in terms of scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, especially for larger or more complex systems.
